# Applications 

> These are the applications to install for Debian, Arch Linux and MacOS

## Terminal (across all three)

- zsh: The only shell I likei
- zsh-syntax-highlighting: Why this isn't standard I don't know.
- tmux: For splitting panes and ssh sessions (not used much anymore)
- vim: Because vim.
- htop
- gtop/gotop: Always one of these variants, usually gtop
- ranger: The perfect terminal file explorer. 
- mc
- bat: The 'cat' command with syntax-highlighting and pagination. Yes!
- The Fuck: Essential for command work.
- git
- Nala: a wrapper for Debian's apt; so much nicer.

## Writing Apps (Linux and Mac)

- Obsidian: The best damn writing environment, period.
- VS Code
- [Zed](https://zed.dev): A new code editor to me. Looking to replace VS Code.

## MacOS Specific

- Arc: My favorite Mac browser
- iTerm2: Essential replacement for the default terminal
- Alfred 4: I like raycast, but Alfred is my home
- Bear: Sometimes I just like a nice, clean environment for longform writing.
