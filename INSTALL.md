# Applications

> These are the applications I use on every install of Debian, Arch Linux and MacOS.

I have a love-hate relationship with applications and I am constantly looking for new ones along the way, though these are the default that go onto every installation I use. I consider many of these *essential* to my productivity across platforms, particularly the common applications I use across operating systems.

Distro and environment agnostic applications are a must. There are, of course, several instances where a Linux version may not exist for an application (Arc for example) where I use the closest *comfortable* replacement; in the case of web-browsing on Linux: Microsoft Edge and Firefox take the place of Arc and Safari.

## Terminal (across all three)

- [zsh](http://zsh.org): The only shell I need.
- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting): Why this isn't standard I don't know.
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki): For splitting panes and ssh sessions (not used much anymore)
- [vim](https://vim.org): Because vim.
- [htop](https://htop.dev)
- gtop/gotop: Always one of these variants, usually gtop
- [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger): The perfect terminal file explorer.
- [mc](https://midnight-commander.org): Fantastic terminal file explorer.
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): The 'cat' command with syntax-highlighting and pagination. Yes!
- [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck): Essential for command work.
- [git](https://github.com): No introduction needed.
- [nala](https://github.com/volitank/nala): a wrapper for Debian's apt; so much nicer.


## Writing Apps (Linux and Mac)

- Obsidian: The best damn writing environment, period.
- VS Code
- [Zed](https://zed.dev): A new code editor to me. Looking to replace VS Code.

## MacOS Specific

- Arc: My favorite Mac browser
- iTerm2: Essential replacement for the default terminal
- Alfred 4: Alfred is my home.
- Bear: Sometimes I just like a nice, clean environment for longform writing.
- [alt-tab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app): Like the Windows versiion, much better than default.
- [loop](https://github.com/MrKai77/Loop?tab=readme-ov-file): Window management radial-style.
- [tiles](https://www.sempliva.com/tiles/): Another excellent window management app, like magnet.
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com): From a longtimer Alfred user, this app is great.
