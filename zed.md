# Zed Configuration

> Zed is quickly becoming my favorite code editor. I use it primarily on my Mac but also plan on adapting it for Linux use.

I am currently using Zed with the default 'One Dark' theme, though I will most likely switch to one of the Catppuccin variants or Rose Pine as those are my peferred color themes for editing text. Ideally I would like to have it congruent with the format I'm writing in, ie. Gruvbox Dark for code, and one of the other themes for Markdown files.
