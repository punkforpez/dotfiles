# Dotfiles
> These dotfiles are used primarily across my Linux distro of choice Debian 12 and on my personal M1 MacBook Air running macOS Sequoia. They can also be used with other Linux distros, obviously, but are tailored to these two. There is a subset of aliases included for Arch Linux, which I also use from time to time as a secondary Linux distro.

## MacOS Sequoia

![MacOS](~/images/mac.jpeg)

My distro-hopping days have ended long ago as I've gotten older but I do want to maintain as much fluidity as possible for migrating across distros if the need ever arises.

## Switching to Everforest

I have been a longtime Gruvbox user, and I will always be a fan, but lately I find myself more attracted to the color palette that Everforest offers and have been slowly switching all of my themeable apps and configurations to the Everforest theme.
