# Dotfiles

> These dotfiles are meant to be somewhat fluid between Linux and MacOS. Some items will need to be uncommented to hit parity.

## NixOS
My primary computer runs NixOS and most of the dotfiles are tailored to this system. My primary Desktop Environment is [KDE](https://kde.org), though I often use Niri and ocassionally, Sway.
