# Dotfiles
> These dotfiles are used primarily across my Linux distro of choice Debian 12 and on my personal M1 MacBook Air running macOS Sequoia. They can also be used with other Linux distros, obviously, but are tailored to these two. There is a subset of aliases included for Arch Linux, which I also use from time to time as a secondary Linux distro.

My distro-hopping days have ended long ago as I've gotten older but I do want to maintain as much fluidity as possible for migrating across distros if the need ever arises.

## A note on Gruvbox
Though I prefer other color themes for non-terminal work, including Ros√© Pine for Bear and Obsidian, I like to use Gruvbox-dark as my color theme for all terminal work. I just find the warmer palette easier on the eyes for long sessions of staring at terminal output, code, etc. 

I use the Gruvbox theme for iTerm2 on macOS, Tilix on Debian and Arch and within vim, my console editor of the past 25 odd years.
