# Dotfiles for Arch
![Arch Linux](i3.png)

## Included in this repo:
I try to keep this as distro-agnostic as possible but there will be some changes needed.
Especially when switching out of major distro types (rpm, apt, etc).

* ~/bin and ~/scripts
* zsh
* irssi
* tmux
* Termite terminal (w/ gruvbox theme)
* i3 / i3status
* vim (gruvbox)
* Xresources (gruvbox)

## To-Do
- [ ] Fully switch to gruvbox
- [x] Cleanup of .zshrc
- [x] Dmenu and rofi theming
- [x] Cleanup of ~/bin scripts
- [x] i3 revamp
- [x] kitty.conf
- [x] kitty color scheme (nord)
