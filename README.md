# Dotfiles

> These dotfiles are meant to be somewhat fluid between Linux and MacOS. Some items will need to be uncommented to hit parity.

## NixOS
My primary computer runs NixOS and most of the dotfiles are tailored to this system. My primary Desktop Environment is [KDE](https://kde.org), though I often use Niri and ocassionally, Sway.

## MacOS
I use MacOS primarily for my day job but also like to keep a development setup on hand.

## Helix
This amazing little editor has completely replaced nvim, Kate, Zed and VSCode for me. I am extremely happy with how Helix has wedged into my life.
